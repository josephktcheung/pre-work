          <p>
            OK, I don't know about you, but I'm tired of that boring Mojo 
            site. I want to build something that's useful to me (or us). So, 
            I'm thinking, let's build a website for the pre-work. We can go 
            through the process step by step.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, at least, it will just be an old-fashioned static 
            website. But maybe later we'll add some CoffeeScript and jQuery 
            and have some fun.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="getting-started">
          <h3>Hooray! So how do we get started?</h3>
          <p>
            Well, the first thing we need to do is to figure out what our site 
            will do, and who it will do it for.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this end, we'll begin by creating personas for our 
            audience. I can think of three different types of user who we might 
            want to serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously, there are the students: you. You are the primary audience 
            as you'll be doing the lessons, so the site should put your needs 
            foremost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there are the instructors, who are also the authors and editors 
            of the content. We'll need to think about them a bit, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we might want to show the site off to others: friends, 
            family, the course manager,curriculum folks, etc. Let's call them 
            guests. So we should at least consider their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we'll create three personas—student, instructor, and guest—one 
            for each type of user.
          </p>

        <section id="building-persona">
          <h3>Great! How do we build a persona, then?</h3>
          <p>
            Well, there's 
            <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1cZZfj6">an excellent explanation</a> 
            on the 
            <a href="http://usability.gov/">usability.gov website</a>, 
            so rather than reinvent the wheel here, we'll just link 
            to that. Go check it out, then come back and we'll build our 
            personas.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's take a look at our three example personas...

          <h3>Should we really use personas?</h3>
          <p>
            Well, that seems a funny question to ask at this juncture. I mean, 
            we just spent a bunch of time making them up (well, I did, anyway). 
            Now we're not going to use them?
          </p>
          <p>
            Heh, heh. Not so fast! We might use them, and we might not. It was 
            important to create them if for no other reason than because there 
            is a very good chance that whatever job you take in the webdev 
            world, you're going to encounter them. Better to know how to make 
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is a minority of developers who think that personas are a 
            bad idea, and they make some very good points. One of the best 
            points is that the personas are made up, and because we are just 
            making them up, we tend fill them with our own stereotypes of our 
            users and then fool ourselves into thinking that we know something 
            about our users!
          </p>
          <p>Gosh, who would do a thing like that? Oh. Yeah. Everyone.</p>
          <p>
            Once the personas have been created, most developers will create 
            user stories next. But these, too, have their detractors. Let's 
            look at a couple of different ways to create user stories, and then 
            see how else we might solve the same problem.
          </p>

        <section id="story">
          <h3>So what's the story?</h3>
          <p>
            We need some way to come up with a specification for our website. 
            One of the biggest mistakes that most newbie developers (and many 
            who really oughta know better) make is to jump straight into coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you will soon discover—if you haven't already—the compulsion to 
            do this is almost irresistible. I—cough, cough—may have even done 
            it myself on occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            But jumping straight to the code is what we in the biz call a Very 
            Bad Idea™. Just. Don't. Do. It.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's the point of spending a lot of time writing code if you're 
            just going to end up throwing it all away and redoing it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's the right way to build a website or Web application:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Determine who your primary audiences are and what they want 
              (Personas? Maybe.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Determine what your site/application needs to do to meet their 
              needs (User stories? Job stories? Hmm. We'll see.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Wireframe out the first few pages
            </li>
            <li>
              Get buy in from the stakeholders
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, and only now, write a little bit of code, then iterate 
              through the above again.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This iterative process (called the Agile Method) allows us to make 
            sure that all the stakeholders are involved at every step of the 
            process, and that mistakes are discovered and corrected quickly. 
            We'll be talking a lot about Agile during WDI. Wait! Talking? We'll 
            be doing Agile. Daily.

          <h3>Well, what do these stories look like?</h3>
          <p>The original format from 2001 looked like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>As a [role], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit]</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here's an example (from Wikipedia):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As a student, I want to see estimated times for completion, so 
              that I may schedule my lesson better.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some developers have a problem with this format, however. They 
            think that the benefit should come first (calling it "hunting the 
            value"), so they swap it around:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In order to [receive benefit] as a [role], I want [goal/desire]
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now we have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
               So that I may schedule my lessons better, as a student, I want 
               to see estimated times for completion.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That worked for a number of years. Then some smart guy pointed out 
            that if you drop the role part, you don't really lose anything. And 
            then that lead to yet another idea, that of the job story. The job 
            story follows this format:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can 
              [expected outcome]
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here's our user story rewritten as a job story:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When I start a lesson, I want to know how long it will take to 
              complete it, so that I can schedule my time appropriately.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The truth is this: it probably doesn't matter. What is most 
            important here is to stimulate discussion involving all the 
            stakeholders—including, if possible, the users themselves—so that 
            the specification—the feature set—is as complete and correct as 
            possible.

            Building the pre-work website is an Agile process—an iterative 
            process—so why not write a few of your own user or job stories? 
            After all, you are the intended users. Send yours to 
            charles.munat@generalassemb.ly and maybe they'll be incorporated 
            into the site's UX. Stranger things have happened...

          <p>
            OK, assuming we have an idea of who our audience(s) is, and we have 
            a few stories to let us know what features we want, the next step 
            is to create a basic wireframe of the site. In this lesson we're 
            just going to build a structure, then we'll fill it in with an 
            example lesson in our next pre-work installment.

            According to Wikipedia (a very useful resource and one I recommend 
            highly): 
            <q>
              A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen 
              blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal 
              framework of a website.
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            I used an online tool called 
            <a href="http://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a> 
            to create a very simple structural wireframe for a typical lesson 
            page. Here it is:
          </p>
          <figure id="example-page-basic-wireframe">
            <figcaption>Example page basic wireframe</figcaption>
            <img src="" alt="wireframe-sample">
          </figure>
        </section>
        <section id="why-so-sketchy">
          <h3>Wait... why does it look so, uh, sketchy?</h3>
          <p>
            That's not an accident! Avoid the temptation to use "pixel perfect" 
            graphics for your wireframes! You are not doing the graphic design 
            here. You are working on the structure and layout of the 
            page—determining what goes where.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use something like PhotoShop and you try to make it look 
            like it will look with all the design elements in place, then you 
            are getting way ahead of yourself and wasting a lot of time. Odds 
            are that this design is going to change many times before it is 
            finalized. You really want to waste all that time? Keep it to 
            simple sketches until we know what we're going to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create an index.html page and code the above structure up (without 
            looking), then check your code against mine (see last page). No 
            cheating!

                Of course you can just jump into coding. All shitty web 
                developer do. Just admit that you suck, and you can skip all
                these formalities. Unfortunately, if "suck" is not the adjective 
                you had in mind to describe your skill set, no, you can't 
                really skip these steps.
